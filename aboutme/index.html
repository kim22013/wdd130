    <p>Hi everyone! This is JaeRan from South Korea. </p>
    <p>I've been a member of Church for 11years. I went on my mission in Las Vegas when I was 35year old. 
        It's been here in U.S. for 6years after my mission this coming December.</p>
    <p>I have a master dgree of Physical Education from Korea University. I opened The K-POP DANCE STUDIO 
        in Salt Lake City, Utah. I got married to my eternal companion, Doug Kim in 2021. Because of 
        my husband's job, I closed my studio. Now I live in Huntsville, Alabama, also known as "The Rocket City". 
        As a foreigner, it is hard to find a job in what I studied. I was looking for a job where I can work at home
        while raising a family. And so I am interested in Web Programming.</p>
    <p>Definitely, it is a BIG challenge for me to learn computer languages in English. But I know that 
        Heavenly Father wants me to stretch my abilities and build kingdom of God.</p>
    <p>I am very excited to explore this new path with you guys. Nice to mee you all!</p>
