        Taking Dance To The Next Level
      </p>
      <p>We believe in giving meaning to movement. Dance is an avenue for self expression, learning self confidence, and finding a place of belonging. We aim to provide a safe place for our students that also develops skills beyond the dance floor, helping them achieve their greatest potential.
        Our studio offers a variety of dance classes in styles of K-pop dance choreography, and more. We also teach mega group dance and private lessons. The studio is available for rental for special occasions upon request and availability.
        The goal of K-pop Dance Studio is to ensure every student has the best experience possible. For this to work, we can’t do it alone. The combined effort of staff, parents, and students are how we will achieve our goals. </p>

      <p>BTS</p>
      <p>We want to introduce our instructors. RM, JIN, SUGA, J-Hope, V, Jimin, Jungkook. Theirs K-pop dance classes became so popular. Why is it easy to love them? 1. They’re talented beyond belief. 2. They’re a family. 3. They’re extremely down-to-earth and humble. 4. They keep it real. 5. Positive messaging. 6. They're socially aware. 7. They bring people together. From their socially conscious lyrics focused mostly on the exploration of identity, positivity, and acceptance–to the tidbits of advice they give during their live streams, it's not hard to see why fans often say that BTS came into their lives at a time they needed them the most. They got invited show on the Late Show on May 15th, 2019. Love yourself! Speak yourself! We want to inspire our students to dance like no one is watching. Let's dance together! </p>

      <h3>CHOREOGRAPHY</h3>
      <p>
        Step By K-POP DANCE STUDIO is the perfect class for those who are new to dance or those who want to learn the basics of dance. Learn one new choreography every month taught by our instructors at a much slower pace. Practice makes perfect, try it out and have some fun!
        Learner classes are taught at a beginner/intermediate level and are best for those who can follow along to the basics of dance. This class is great for those who have some experience but aren't quite confident in pursuing a fast-paced class just yet. By learning choreography that focuses on the basics, you will strengthen your foundational skills and improve your ability to pick up and retain choreography.
        Master classes are taught at a intermediate/advanced level and are best for those who are experienced dancers or those who want a challenge. Taking classes that contain the unique style of the choreographer is essential to developing your own style. It is also important to know a variety of dance styles and be able to take classes confidently when pursuing dance professionally. Once you take challenging classes you will see your skillset grow.
        Pop-up classes are special classes that gives you the opportunity to learn from choreographers outside of K-POP DANCE STUDIO. Meet respected choreographers in the dance industry from all over the world right here at K-POP Dance Studio.
