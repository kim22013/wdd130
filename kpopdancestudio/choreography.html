            <p>Step By K-POP DANCE STUDIO is the perfect class for those who are new to dance or those who want to learn the basics of dance. Learn one new choreography every month taught by our instructors at a much slower pace. Practice makes perfect, try it out and have some fun! Learner classes are taught at a beginner/intermediate level and are best for those who can follow along to the basics of dance. This class is great for those who have some experience but aren't quite confident in pursuing a fast-paced class just yet. By learning choreography that focuses on the basics, you will strengthen your foundational skills and improve your ability to pick up and retain choreography. Master classes are taught at a intermediate/advanced level and are best for those who are experienced dancers or those who want a challenge. Taking classes that contain the unique style of the choreographer is essential to developing your own style. It is also important to know a variety of dance styles and be able to take classes confidently when pursuing dance professionally. Once you take challenging classes you will see your skillset grow. Pop-up classes are special classes that gives you the opportunity to learn from choreographers outside of K-POP DANCE STUDIO. Meet respected choreographers in the dance industry from all over the world right here at K-POP Dance Studio.</p>
